**Artist Statement**:  
"Monuments are always products of their time. Always reflections of power." -Paul Farber
Our country, the U.S., is currently taking a critical look at the monuments in our public spaces and what they signify.

Monumental asks: What is worthy of commemoration? And who decides? Since many monuments are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the UNESCO Media Arts Exhibition is a symbolic space to re-examine the concept of civic monuments.

As a participatory installation, Monumental You invites the audiences to be a part of the conversation by projecting their faces to a large format sculpture, and asks to reconfigure the idea of a monument.
